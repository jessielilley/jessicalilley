                <p>As autumn rolls in and we see influencers scrounging around for the new 'viral must-haves' of the season, it leaves
                     the average consumer unable to keep up. Of course, many have proposed the idea of re-wearing the same clothes year
                      on year, but it's a concept that doesn't seem to be catching on. To perfect a 'time capsule wardrobe' you need 
                      pieces that are just that; timeless. I'd like to propose funky tights as a strong contender. </p>

                <p>Tights might've been around for hundreds of years, but the popularity peak of coloured tights can be argued. One thing
                 that most can agree on is that they were widely popularised by British fashion designer, Mary Quant. Credited as a designer
                 of the miniskirt (iconic in itself) her brightly coloured tights were a staple of the 60s. We've seen coloured tights pop
                 up in different forms since then, whether it's a monochrome matching outfit or nylon swapped for cotton with a knitted 
                 look, we've yet to see them cycle back to being a prominent everyday look.</p>

                <p>So why should we start wearing them again? With gen-z's ongoing infatuation with the 2000's and Gossip Girl, it's 
                    surprising that they haven't already come back in. Blair Waldorf loved a coloured tight, and we all love Blair 
                    Waldorf. The great thing about them is how versatile they are, there's no need to dress them up like Blair, they 
                    would pair great with a casual denim mini skirt and some battered brown boots. Or, if dressing up is more your style,
                     a pair of heeled Mary Janes and a fancy skirt can do you no wrong.</p>
                
                <p>The other great thing about tights is that they're tights! They can be made cheaply, making the look much more accessible
                 for those who don't wish to spend Â£40+ on a single pair. At the other end of the scale, people who wish to invest in good
                 quality pairs to last a lifetime absolutely can, (maybe not a lifetime, they are still tights!).</p>

                <p>With the range of colours available, you're certain to find one to match every season. Some may argue that tights in summer
                     are not the move, but when we're discussing an English summer, I can assure you that an extra layer will certainly be 
                     appreciated! And why stop at just coloured tights? If you're anything like me and love a little glitter, glittery tights
                      are the perfect way to add some more depth to an outfit, don't expect mind blowing levels of comfort though. </p>

                <p>As for where to buy your tights, it's completely up to you. I like to go for around 50 dernier so that they're a little 
                    lighter, so here are some unsponsored ideas, buy at your own risk!</p>

                <p>M&S - this is where I've always sourced my tights, and is a classic option at a decent price point. The only downside here
                     is the limited colours and that you're forced to buy in a three pack, rather than picking exactly which colours you want.
                      I'm sure M&S also used to make a pack with cyan and purple, but I can't seem to find it.</p>

                <p>Snag - snag is a brand whose vibes and inclusivity I can absolutely get behind, whilst I haven't personally tried their tights,
                     the reviews are great. I love that the sizing is unique and inclusive, but I wish there was more colour variety in the 50 dernier!</p>

                     <p>Jacquard Mary Quant - it would be wrong to not include these on the list. Relive the 60s with these revamped Mary Quant tights
                         featuring the iconic flower logo. The price point is a little high for me and I prefer a lower dernier, but if you're looking
                          for something bright and iconic, these would definitely be for you. </p>
