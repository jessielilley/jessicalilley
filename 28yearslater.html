                <p>When a franchise is ultimately revisited despite lying stagnant for more than two decades after the inaugural
                     feature, it inevitably raises the question of what exactly is trying to be achieved. The dawn of an endless
                      cinematic universe? Or perhaps an all-revealing prequel? <i>28 years later</i> proves to be neither, and instead 
                      lays the groundwork for a thrilling, if not frightfully disturbing, trilogy. Britain's rage-fuelled infected
                       have made a return, and this time with a thickened diversity of shapes and sizes, how many calories are in a worm?!</p>

                <p>The first portion of the film is a juxtaposing combination of wholesome family bonding and a degree of graphic violence
                     designed to escalate the shock factor. And shock it does, especially when paired with some unsettling fragments 
                     of found footage-esque video. The story flags a little initially, instead making room for the introduction of 
                     the newfound infected, it isn't until the audience has encountered the full extent of what the mainland has 
                     to offer that an objective is established.</p>

                <p>It's difficult to discuss <i>28 years later</i> without touching on the impact of its first trailer, garnering nearly 
                    30 million views on YouTube alone. The driving force behind its success has to have been the unconventional 
                    audio, a chilling narration of the 1903 poem <i>Boots</i>, which elicits an unwavering sense of panic alongside 
                    frightening imagery extracted from the film with little explanation, further exemplifying the terror. It 
                    was refreshing to see the poem reused in the film, although not with quite the same impact, as repurposing
                     teaser audio tends to be less conventional.</p>
                
                <p>Pleasingly, the film retains some of the gritty cinematography utilised previously in the franchise, though 
                    it's obviously not designed to reflect pre-2010 this time. Frequent cuts and jolty angle changes all 
                    contribute to the build up of both disorientation and tension, prominent themes throughout the feature.
                     It was also gratifying to see a few fleeting moments of humour break up events, it was tough not to draw 
                     a comparison to the whole 'things that would put a Victorian child into a coma' saga.</p>

                <p>Commenting on narrative choices is tricky when you're anticipating more depth to be added to the plot in the
                     coming films, but for the most part the story lacked some complexity. That's not to undermine the emotional
                      connection established between characters, what we saw between Spike (Alfie Williams) and Jodie Comer's
                       Isla was especially moving, but it felt as though the focus was on stunning the audience with gore and
                        then lulling them with sentimentality with little concrete matter in between.</p>

                <p>What the film undoubtedly achieved was setting up the events of the next, between the clues scattered throughout
                     and the complete tonal shift of the finale, <i>28 years and a little bit longer later</i> (an educated guess) has 
                     plenty of potential, especially after confirmation that we see the return of Kelson (Ralph Fiennes), a character
                      whose motives were not thoroughly dissected. Regardless of what might be in store next, <i>28 years later</i>
                       is a gripping introduction to this new era of infected, and well worth a watch (provided you can stomach
                        a virus film after Covid).</p>
