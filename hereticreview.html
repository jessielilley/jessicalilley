                <p>An fiendish theologian is one way to break Hugh Grant free of typecasting, and it's an endeavour that
                     <i>Heretic</i> executes with grisly flair. The horror effortlessly integrates religious themes into a 
                     thrilling plotline, simultaneously drawing attention to the real-world concern of the safety of Mormon
                      missionaries as well as posing harrowing theological questions, all while unnerving the audience with
                       Mr Reed's (Hugh Grant) bizarre nature.  </p>

                <p>The film's seamless use of dialogue is what initially stood out to me, don't get me wrong, there's a lot
                     of talking (very heavy at the beginning especially) but it's manufactured in a way that doesn't for a 
                     second disengage the audience. This is achieved through a meaningful use of props in combination with 
                     incredibly natural performances delivered by all three main actors to drive the narrative at a 
                     well-paced tempo.</p>

                <p>We follow Sister Barnes (Sophie Thatcher) and Sister Paxton (Chloe East) as they knock on the wrong man's
                     door and are subjected to his unfamiliar religious ventures all while scrambling to escape his home. 
                     Whilst the idea of escaping from a bad guy is cliché and conventional of a horror, it's the theological
                      elements that set <i>Heretic</i> apart from the rest. The main cast being limited to a trio is a key factor 
                      in the plot not feeling over-complicated, whilst still dealing with complicated themes. It leaves 
                      breathing room for the audience to digest and interpret what they're seeing and hearing without becoming
                       overwhelmed with character after character.</p>
                
                <p>To touch on Hugh Grant as the antagonist again, it's almost difficult to pinpoint what makes him scary. Both
                     his appearance and demeanour are warm and welcoming, an indicator as to how he managed to lure the girls 
                     inside, and even as he locks them in his home it's strange, but not downright terrifying. I think what 
                     makes Mr Reed work as a villain is the eccentric, unpredictable nature, especially from a man who seems 
                     so composed. As an audience, our fear of him is of course amplified by the reactions of the missionaries,
                      with Thatcher and East both providing compelling performances which knit the plot together.</p>

                <p>Rather than relying on jumpscares, the movie instead utilises unsettling psychological elements and mild 
                    gore to frighten those watching. That being said, there are a few jumpy moments, but it's nice when terror
                     is built up slowly to a climax, rather than being immediately established. This is something that <i>Heretic</i>
                      does exceptionally well.</p>

                <p>Whilst the cinematography and set are noteworthy, it's really the narrative and acting that drive<i> Heretic </i>
                    forwards and propel it to become the ghastly, thought-provoking thriller that it is.</p>
