                <h1>The Leopard Print and Bows are Too Much</h1>
                <img class="articleimage" src="images/woman with bow 900 x 1200.png" alt="woman with bow in her hair">

                <p>â€¦well, sort of. Animal print and hair bows are arguably timeless classics, with fur pelts being worn 
                    for centuries and a staple in ancient culture after culture, whilst bows have been a thing for as 
                    long as ribbons, I don't think we'll be entirely getting rid of either anytime soon. Don't get me 
                    wrong though, bow graphics and leopard print jeans are the epitome of tacky, I don't care how much 
                    your favourite celebrity loves them.</p>

                <p>Maybe that was a little harsh, I'm sure everyone looks spectacular in the clothes they choose to wear.
                     But bows belong in your hair. The accessory has had an exponential resurgence in the past few years,
                      likely due to the 'coquette' (hyper feminine) aesthetic where everything is cute and dainty. As 
                      another contributing factor to the comeback, I would present to you Gracie Abrams. Whilst other 
                      artists have also laid claim to the bow, it's been the leading accessory at her concerts even before
                       it properly took off again.</p>

                <p>So hair bows are classic and never really left, but it's the bow print everything I have an issue with. 
                    It feels like the second anything with the graphic is released, people in their hundreds flock to the 
                    shops to get their hands on it, just for the sake of an emblem? It feels like every high street retailer
                     has released some version of bow jeans, and a bow jumper, and a bow blanket, and a bow mug, and the 
                     list goes on. Capitalising on trends is of course key for stores to 'keep up with the times', but it's
                      mind-bening how they put out all these new designs so quickly. Ultra fast fashion brands like Primark
                       and PLT are obviously the worst offenders, but it's interesting to see how LoveShackFancy has strayed
                        slightly away from the floral print to focus more on the bows. Another more expensive brand that has
                         an interesting trend relationship is Ganni and leopard print.</p>
                
                <p>The most iconic era of leopard print was certainly the 2000s, the way it's worn now just doesn't have the
                     same authenticity to it, it feels forced rather than how it was so effortlessly intertwined with y2k fashion.
                      Leopard print in 2024 feels the same as how we look back on cow print in 2020, it just doesn't work. I think
                       this is due to what it's paired with. In 2024 the emphasis is on neutrals and basics, leopard print works 
                       well with the colourful chaos of 2000s fashion, not 2024 business casual. Drifting back to the Ganni website,
                        the way the leopard print is styled, wholly supports this theory. It's paired with basics and neutrals, 
                        there's no personality and flair like there used to be, it's just not giving anything.</p>

                <p>Largely, if not entirely, due to fast fashion companies and their miniature price tags, both bows and leopard print
                 are hugely accessible for the majority of people. This massive influx of everyone wearing the same thing is the sole 
                 reason why a trend dies, everyone gets bored and moves onto the next thing. The transactions are so small that nobody
                 pays them any thought, they just swipe and move on. When looking at these huge Shein hauls on Tiktok, it's interesting
                 to note just how many of the pieces are bow print, or leopard print, or just generally awful. </p>

                <p>One might hope that after this trend cycle, people develop some individuality and begin to think for themselves, but 
                    with the fast paced nature of social media it's almost inevitable that the second leopard print and bows begin to 
                    fade, something equally as awful will ultimately take their place.</p>
